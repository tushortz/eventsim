Models
======
The Models' module contains six methods for calculating/generating ``probability``, ``estimated variance``, ``estimated mean``, ``estimated standard deviation``, ``expectation value`` and ``discreteEmp`` 

Models' methods take mostly two arguments: ``outcome`` and ``cummulative probability`` but some methods (with asterisks) take ``optional arguments`` which is `amount of times to be generated`.

To use the models module, you need to first import it as will be shown later. The model module has six methods which are:

discreteemp :sup:`*`
--------------------
The discrete method takes two or three arguments: **outcomes**, **cummulative probability**, and an optional **amount to generate**. This is then used to generate a random outcome if only two arguments are supplied and a list of outcomes depending on the amount supplied as the third optional argument. 

importing and usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. literalinclude:: ./programs/models.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 1-6

You could also import all the modules
.. .. code-block:: python
..    :emphasize-lines: 3,5

..    def some_function():
..        interesting = False
..        print 'This line is highlighted.'
..        print 'This one is not...'
..        print '...but this one is.'

Example
^^^^^^^
.. literalinclude:: ./programs/models.py
      :language: python
      :lines: 4

.. .. sidebar:: Sidebar Title
..    :subtitle: Optional Sidebar Subtitle

..    .. code::
